# Themes

The UI package includes several pre-built themes to help you create consistent designs.

## Default Theme

The default theme provides a clean, modern look suitable for most applications.

## Dark Theme

A dark variant that's easy on the eyes and perfect for developer tools.

## Custom Themes

You can also create custom themes by extending the base theme configuration.

```tsx
import { createTheme } from '@your-package/ui'

const customTheme = createTheme({
  colors: {
    primary: '#your-color',
    secondary: '#another-color'
  }
})
```
