# UI Package

The Bitcoin Builder Kit UI package provides a UI system for building consistent looking UIs for your bitcoin products. While some components are bitcoin-specific, some are more generic and applicable to a wide variety of applications.

Th UI package uses [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components), which should be compatible with most modern web frameworks. However, there are also React-wrapped components for React projects.

## Getting Started

First install the UI package:

```bash
pnpm add @sbddesign/bui-ui
```

Next, setup the appropriate theming in your project. You will do this by applying a `data-theme` and `data-mode` attribute in your HTML.

The `data-mode` can be `light` or `dark`. The `data-theme` can be `bitcoindesign` or `conduit`. Learn more about themes in [Tokens](/packages/tokens/).


```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- head content -->
  </head>
  <body data-theme="bitcoindesign" data-mode="light">
    <!-- your app goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

Import the CSS so that the componenets have appropriate styling. Typically, you will do this only once, at a higher level part of your app (e.g. `main.js`, `App.tsx`, etc.)

```
import '@sbddesign/bui-ui/tokens.css'
```

 Next, import a component to use in your app.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="JavaScript">
    ```javascript
    import '@sbddesign/bui-ui/button.js'
    ```
    </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="React">
    ```javascript
    import { BuiButtonReact as BuiButton } from '@sbddesign/bui-ui/react'
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Finally, display the component in your app.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="JavaScript">
    ```html
    <bui-button label="Receive Bitcoin"></bui-button>
    ```
    </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="React">
    ```jsx
    <BuiButton label="Receive Bitcoin" />
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
